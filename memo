Hi Dr. Ames 

There are several things I am hoping to learn from this class: 

* Learn to use code to solve big real world engineering problems
* Learn how to develop functional and intuitive engineering web apps
* Learn how to better work effictively as a team member

Final Project Info:
Our project is to make an online tool that will give accurate estimates of
infiltration on construction sites. This tool could be useful to owners,
builders, and engineers in easily obtaining infiltration information that 
will contribute to more accurate cost estimates and expected equipment needs. 
Kyler (our project leader) worked for Provo city and has valuable experience
on the topic of water infiltration on job sites.
